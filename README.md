"# connect4project" 
My Project is the game connect 4.
You can play against a computer or against someone locally.  The objective is to have four of your token in a row, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally.  When you click it places your token it goes to the bottom of the colomn you selected.  The game ends when one player has connected 4.  you can then restart the game with the current score at the bottom.
